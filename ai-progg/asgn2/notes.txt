For the gamestate:
    need to init the state of the game
    need all legal actions that we can take
    need child nodes generated with each action from a node
    need to determine win state

For MCTS:
    Run search to generate statistics?? No understand, elaborate 
    According to the tutorial https://medium.com/@quasimik/monte-carlo-tree-search-applied-to-letterpress-34f41c86e238
    he has this class to generate statistics and build the search tree with the information from the simulations. 

Probably also need a node class for the search tree that has
statistics for that node etc

What if I keep the tree just as a datastrucutre of nodes. Each node knows its parent and childs


IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
We initialize the search with root node and all its child nodes.
Then we choose a random one
Then we simulate a play and based on the outcome of that play we update the value of the leaf node from the previous step. 


QUESTION:
1. go to leaf node, then expand it and run simulations?? Or go to leaf node, run simulations???
