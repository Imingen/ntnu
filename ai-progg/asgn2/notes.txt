For the gamestate:
    need to init the state of the game
    need all legal actions that we can take
    need child nodes generated with each action from a node
    need to determine win state

For MCTS:
    Run search to generate statistics?? No understand, elaborate 
    According to the tutorial https://medium.com/@quasimik/monte-carlo-tree-search-applied-to-letterpress-34f41c86e238
    he has this class to generate statistics and build the search tree with the information from the simulations. 

Probably also need a node class for the search tree that has
statistics for that node etc
