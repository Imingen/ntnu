# N = Number of pieces on the board
# K = Maximum number of pieces a player can take off the board during their turn,
# the minimum pieces to remove is ONE. 
# Given N & K, the rules of the game are: Each player take turn removing 
# pieces from the board and the last person to remove a piece is the winner.
