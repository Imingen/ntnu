1. Representing the game state
    a) Simple code for representing the state
        Need to be able to change size of board
    b) How to vizualise it
    c) How to represent it for neural net shit

2. Do the MCTS algorithm 
    a) Same parameters as last project needs to be modifiable

3. Do the neural net shit, probably part of the MCTS algorithm

4. Tournament of progressive policies (TOPP)

TODO:
Check state is win/loss
Implement MCTS basic 



state check pseudocode:

# Find first node for a player e.g along the starting axix for certain player

for piece along y axis i.e for player two
